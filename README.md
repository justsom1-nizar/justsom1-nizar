# Hi, I'm Nizar 👋

I'm a Computer Engineering student at McGill University interested in **embedded systems, electronics design, and FPGA development**. I enjoy working across the stack—from designing PCBs and writing low-level firmware to experimenting with VHDL architectures and building real-time embedded applications.

### 🔧 What I work with
- **Embedded Systems:** ESP32, STM32, FreeRTOS, ESP-IDF, C/C++
- **Electronics:** Altium Designer, PCB design, sensors & hardware interfaces (I²C, SPI, DMA)
- **Digital Design:** VHDL, RISC-V, FPGA projects on Basys-3 & Cyclone V
- **Software:** Python tooling, data visualization, automation scripts

### 📌 Highlights
- Designed ESP32-S3 sensor PCBs and firmware during my biomedical electronics internship.  
- Built a pre-concentrator PCB and multi-threaded testing pipelines at Noze (Stratuscent).  
- Improved RF modulation-recognition CNN models at INRS, reducing parameters by 80% with increased accuracy.  
- Created multiple FPGA projects including a pipelined RISC-V CPU and VGA-based systems.

### 🚀 What I’m exploring
- Advanced embedded systems and low-power architectures  
- Hardware-accelerated AI and near-sensor processing  
- More FPGA/SoC-based system design
